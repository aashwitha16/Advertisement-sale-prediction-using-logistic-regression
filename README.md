# Advertisement-sale-prediction-using-logistic-regression
In this quick machine learning project, based on the advertising dataset, I'll use a predictive model to forecast sales.
By the output of the model we can use our time to educate him or her about the product.
Based on the customer's age and salary as independent variables we get the dependent variable whether he or she would purchase the product.

LIBRARIES USED
Pandas - 1.5. 0
Numpy - 1.23. 4 
Sklearn - 1.1.3

DATASET
Attributes - age,salary(independent variables) and status (product buying)-(0,1) (dependent variable)
